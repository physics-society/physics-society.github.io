title : "Many-body localization"
description : "Many-body localization phase transition is an interesting phenomenon
developed recently.This localization phenomenon addresses the fundamental
question of how a quantum many body systems should evolve when isolated
from the environment. For these systems even when the governing
Schrodinger equation is linear which suggest thermalization of the system,
these systems do not thermalize under the dynamics of their own
Hamiltonian and remain localized. Here Localization implies that the
information stored through local freedom within the initial state will
remain within local freedoms. These isolated disordered many body systems
do not follow the laws of equilibrium statistical mechanics and have
potential applications in developing future quantum devices."
