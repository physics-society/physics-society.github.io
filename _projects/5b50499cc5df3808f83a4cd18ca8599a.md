title : "Morse oscillator dynamics: revivals and fractional revivals"
description : "Done during summer 2017 in IIST, Thiruvananthapuram. Selected through IIST's internship programme.
Time evolution of states for the Morse potential Hamiltonian was theoretically studied. The main focus was given on revivals and fractional revivals of the coherent states. The revival and fractional revival times and the corresponding states were calculated for a few specific initial states."
