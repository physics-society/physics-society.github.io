title : "Cold Fusion"
description : "UGP(IITK)-Cold fusion(also known as LENR) is a recent phenomena in which abnormally large amounts of energy is observed to be released during certain electrolysis experiments. It has no solid theoretical groundwork as of now and the experiments have also not produced uniform results. I performed an electrolysis experiment(Ni cathode and Pt anode in water) and tried to observe transmutation reactions which are proposed to be associated with cold fusion.
(Note: This topic receives a lot of skepticism from most academics)"
